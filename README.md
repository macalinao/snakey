# snakey
A simple little snake game for the terminal, written in C.

I don't know C, so this code will suck.

## Compiling
**snakey** uses GNU make to handle things. To compile, use the command `make`. If you don't have GNU make installed,
you might want to install it sometime. It's a really nice program.
